  ### What’s a creative brief?

  In the best cases, a creative brief is a document created through initial meetings, interviews, readings and discussions between a client and designer before any work begins. Throughout the project, the creative brief continues to inform and guide the work. A good creative brief will answer these questions:
  * What is this project?
  * Who is it for?
  * Why are we doing it?
  * What needs to be done? By whom? By when?
  * Where and how will it be used?

  4. Audience: Who are we talking to? What do they think of us? Why should they care?
  5. Competitors: Who is the competition? What are they telling the audience that we should be telling them? SWOT analysis on them? What differentiates us from them?
  6. Tone: How should we be communicating? What adjectives describe the feeling or approach?
  7. Message: What are we saying with this piece exactly? Are the words already developed or do we need to develop them? What do we want audiences to take away?
  8. Visuals: Are we developing new images or picking up existing ones? If we are creating them, who/what/where are we photographing or illustrating? And why?
  9. Details: Any mandatory information that must be included? List of deliverables? Preconceived ideas? Format parameters? Limitations and restrictions? Timeline, schedule, budget?

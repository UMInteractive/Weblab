## FINAL PROJECT

Create a website for a portfolio, a story, or on a subject you care deeply about. Along with your website you will submit sketches/wireframes, a creative brief, and an online marketing and SEO plan. You should also include links to **5** websites that served as inspiration for your work.

### Creative Brief

In the best cases, a creative brief is a document created through initial meetings, interviews, readings and discussions between a client and designer before any work begins. Throughout the project, the creative brief continues to inform and guide the work. A good creative brief will answer these questions:

* What is this project?
* Who is it for?
* Why are we doing it?
* What needs to be done? By whom? By when?
* Where and how will it be used?

[The 10 most important things to include in a creative brief](https://www.mohawkconnects.com/feltandwire/2011/02/08/the-creative-brief-10-things-it-must-include/)

1. Background Summary: Who is the client? What is the product or service? What are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (or SWOTs) involved with this product or service? Are there existing research, reports and other documents that help you understand the situation?
2. Overview: What is the project? What are we designing and why? Why do we need this project? What’s the opportunity?
3. Drivers: What is our goal for this project? What are we trying to achieve? What is the purpose of our work? What are our top three objectives?
4. Audience: Who are we talking to? What do they think of us? Why should they care?
5. Competitors: Who is the competition? What are they telling the audience that we should be telling them? SWOT analysis on them? What differentiates us from them?
6. Tone: How should we be communicating? What adjectives describe the feeling or approach?
7. Message: What are we saying with this piece exactly? Are the words already developed or do we need to develop them? What do we want audiences to take away?
8. Visuals: Are we developing new images or picking up existing ones? If we are creating them, who/what/where are we photographing or illustrating? And why?
9. Details: Any mandatory information that must be included? List of deliverables? Preconceived ideas? Format parameters? Limitations and restrictions? Timeline, schedule, budget?
10. People: Who are we reporting to? Who exactly is approving this work? Who needs to be informed of our progress? By what means?

### Wireframes

Create simple layouts for each distinct pages, scan or take pictures of your designs and place them in your project folder.

### Online marketing and SEO plan

Come up with a marketing plan for your website. Your goal is to promote your website. Using a budget of $1000, explain your business rationale. Choose either [twitter](https://ads.twitter.com/), [google adwords](https://ads.google.com/home/), or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/) to create your campaign.

The following questions are a good guide for creating your plan. Please turn this part in as a PDF or Word document.

* What areas/locations are you target and why?
* List what keywords are you going to use and buy?
* What is the duration of your campaign? Try to explain your reasoning on the duration. Is there an event, etc?.
* Include screenshots of your campaign
